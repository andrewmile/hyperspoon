# HyperSpoon

A tool and a set of plugins to make [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) easier to use, especially when working with Hyper key configurations. Created as a part of [TrainYourKeyboard](https://trainyourkeyboard.com).

## Installation

Full installation and usage instructions can be found in the upcoming blog post about Training Your Keyboard on the [Tighten blog](https://tighten.co/blog), but here are the simple installation instructions:

1. Copy `Hyper.spoon` and the file inside it into your `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons` directory
1. Copy `Helpers.spoon` and the file inside it into your `~/.hammerspoon/Spoons` directory

That's it!
